#### Flutter Mobile Developer (SDE) | 4+ Years of Experience at Nonstop IO

I'm a passionate software engineer specializing in building user-friendly mobile apps with Flutter. Over 4 years, I've honed my skills in Firebase, Firestore, Google Maps, and Bluetooth integration to create seamless user experiences.

Beyond code, I'm actively involved in the open-source community (OSS) and enjoy sharing knowledge. I've even delivered a talk and conducted a workshop to further engage with the developer community.
